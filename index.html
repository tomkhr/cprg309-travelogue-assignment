                <p>Hi, My name is <span id="authorName">Tom</span>, I am an Interactive Design student at SAIT, and this is my Travelogue. I don't consider myself as a well traveled person, but I have visited a few places around the world that I enjoyed. After I graduate the Interactive Design program and start building my career, I am hoping to travel and explore more.</p>

        <h2 id="firstArticleH2">Paris, France</h2>
        <p>I have visited Paris in the summer of 2022. It lives up to it's name and reputation. It's an incredible place to visit. History, architecture, art and fashion are embedded into every corner. Sitting in one of the parks or squares, waiting for the Eiffel tower to light up is maybe cliche, but it inspires you. The Louvre museum is suprisingly inexpensive, and is filled with more art and exponats than you can cover in one day. Also, the baked goods and the coffee are incredible in the city. I've had the smoothes Cafe Long in paris, like silk. On another note, beware of the busy toursty areas, not to be a victim of pickpocketing, or some scam. Nothing major to worry about, but being careful is always a good tip. If you haven't visited Paris yet, I strongly suggest you include it in your future travel plans.</p>

        <h2>Villefranche-sur-Mer, France</h2>
        <p>Villefranche-sur-Mer, a small French town in the south of France, not far from the Italian border, as well as a short train ride from Monaco. I visited it on the same trip as Paris in the summer of 2022. Villefranche-sur-Mer is a quaint, slow-paced shore town, filled with colourful houses. It's a great day trip (20 minute train ride) from Nice, which is the major touristic attraction in the area. Villefranche-sur-Mer is filled with great restaurants with live music, unique gift shops, and friendly people. A highly recommended place to visit.</p>

    <article id="london">
        <h2>London, UK</h2>
        <p>London is royal. It needs no intrudction. Visitng the Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square and Big Ben were my favourite places. Although London is filled with beautiful architecture with such high detail in every corner. Planty of hotels that are affordable. The only fish and chips I had in London was a complete disappointment. Probably choosing the pub that is the nearest to my hotel was a bad call. If you ever visited or will visit London, notice the smell in the London Underground subway. It has a charming and cozy smell of old upholstery. It's impossible to describe, but it is a smell that really surprised me and stayed in my memory.</p>
